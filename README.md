### Installation

First install XMonad and XMobar

```
sudo apt-get install xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar
```

Then clone this repo into your home directory as `.xmonad`

From there, this should work as long as you use XMonad as your window manager.

### Configuration

Most of the configuration is done through `xmonad.hs`.

For easy theming, convenient color variables are listed at the top of the file.
